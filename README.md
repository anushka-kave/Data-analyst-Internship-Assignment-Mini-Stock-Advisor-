# 📈 Rule-Based Mini Stock Advisor  
A simple rule-based (NO machine learning) stock advisor that generates *BUY / SELL / HOLD* signals based on daily percentage change logic. Python is used for data processing & rule evaluation, and R is used for generating plots.

## 🧠 Project Overview

### *⿡ Compute Daily Percentage Change*
percentage_change = ((closing_price - opening_price) / opening_price) * 100

### *⿢ BUY Rules*
A *BUY* signal is generated if ANY ONE is true:
- Today’s % change > *+2%* AND yesterday had positive change  
- Today AND yesterday both had a positive change

### *⿣ SELL Rules*
A *SELL* signal is generated if ANY ONE is true:
- Today’s % change < *–2%*  
- Today AND yesterday both had negative change

### *⿤ HOLD Rule*
A HOLD signal is assigned when:
- % change is between *–2% and +2%*, AND  
- No BUY/SELL rule is triggered
